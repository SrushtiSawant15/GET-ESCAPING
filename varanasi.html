               <p> <strong> Varanasi is another sacred city in India with a very old history. It could possibly be the world's oldest inhabited city. Known as the city of Lord Shiva, the god of creation and destruction, it's believed that anyone who dies in Varanasi will be liberated from the cycle of reincarnation. Even a wash in the Ganges River is said to cleanse away all sins. <br>

                 Varanasi was originally called Kashi during Vedic times. It was officially named Varanasi in 1956, although it was known as Benaras before that (said to be a variant of Varanasi). The name is derived from the meeting of the Varuna and Assi rivers.                <br>
                
                 The fascinating thing about this mystical city is that its rituals are revealed openly to along the many riverside ghats, which are used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead. Yoga, blessings, massages, shaves, and games of cricket are among the other activities you'll find performed by the river's edge  <br>

                 October to March are the best months to visit Varanasi. This is when the weather is at its coolest. Winters are refreshing and pleasant, albeit chilly at night. The temperature gets uncomfortably hot from April onward, easily reaching 35 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). This is followed by monsoon rain from July to September. </strong>
